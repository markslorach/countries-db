# Countries DB

A simple application to view information on the countries of the world. Based on the [Frontend Mentor REST Countries challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui
- Axios

## Features
* View a list of all countries
* Search for a country
* Filter countries by region
* View more info about a country and its bordering countries
* Fully mobile responsive

## Future
I plan on building this into a full-stack application with user authentication and a database so users can add their favourite countries.
